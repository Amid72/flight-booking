# ✈️ SkyLine Flight Booking Web Application

SkyLine is a sleek, single-page flight booking interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers users a simple and interactive experience to search flights, enter passenger/payment details, and simulate a booking confirmation—all within the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- Animated loading screen for better UX
- Real-time flight search based on user input
- Auto-generated list of mock flights
- Dynamic form validation for card and passenger details
- Smooth transitions between booking stages
- Booking confirmation animation and auto-reset

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── styles.css       # Styles for layout, forms, transitions
└── script.js        # Frontend logic for interaction and validation
````

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Enjoy booking a flight! (Simulation only.)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3 (including animations and layout styling)
* Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation and validation)

## 🔐 Form Validation

The payment form uses regex-based validation to ensure:

* Card number: 13–19 digits
* Expiry date: MM/YY format
* CVV: 3–4 digits
